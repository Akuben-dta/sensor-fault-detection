# 🧠 Sensor Fault Detection System

## 📄 Project Overview
This project implements a machine learning–based system for detecting faults in sensor data. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training to identify abnormal sensor readings. The system improves reliability in environments where continuous sensor monitoring is crucial — such as industrial automation, manufacturing systems, and IoT-based environments.
